# javascript-color-box
we are going to create a color box for RGB colors that refer to red ,green and blue values colors.
the range of numbers for each color is between 0 to 225. so , we have 256 green valuse and 256 red values and finaly 256 blue vales.
for example (0,0,0) means 0 red,0 green and 0 blue . it demonestrates black color and (255,255,255) shows white color.
according to above,  we have 256*256*256 diffrent colors for RGB colors.
to create a color box step by step, we should create a simple html page then get some style by css, after that creat a changable range and finally control these ranges by DOM ( document object model ) with javascript function.
you should download both css file and javascript file and html file and put all of them in the same folder and name them as style and myScript because, we have called them by these names in the html file.
