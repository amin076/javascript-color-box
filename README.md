# javascript-color-box
we are going to create a color box for RGB colors that refer to red ,green and blue values colors.
te range of number for each color is between 0 to 225. so , we have 256 green valuse and 256 red values and finaly 256 blue vales.
for example (0,0,0) means 0 red,0 green and 0 blue . it demonestrates black color and (255,255,255) shows white colors.
according to above  we have 256*256*256 diffrent colors for RGB colors.
to create a color box step by step, we should create a simple html page then get some style by css after that creat a changable range and finally control these ranges by DOM ( document object model ) with javascript function.
